## Dependencies

### `ulimit`

OS X gives you a very small limit on open file handles. Even with a
backend that uses very few file handles, it's possible to run out. See
[Open Files Limit][openfileslimit] for more information about changing the limit.


## Install Riak TS

To install Riak TS on your Mac, [download] the package and then run:

```bash
tar zxvf riak-ts-1.4.0-OSX-x86_64.tar.gz
cd riak-ts-1.4.0
```


## Activate Riak TS node

Once you've installed Riak TS, start it on your node:

```bash
